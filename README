Requirements
PHP 7.2.9 or higher;
PDO-SQLite PHP extension enabled;
and the usual Symfony application requirements.
Installation:
- git clone 
- composer install


Run the app:
$ symfony serve
Then access the application in your browser at the given URL (https://localhost:8000 by default).

If you don't have the Symfony binary installed, run php -S localhost:8000 -t public/ to use the built-in PHP web server or configure a web server like Nginx or Apache to run the application.
